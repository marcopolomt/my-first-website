    # My First Website Readme.
    
    Introduction into the contents and purpose behind my first website. 
    ## Purpose behind this site.
    From what I gather thus far, this site is part of my course work within my full-stack developer course through The Learning People in collaboration with the code institute.
    It seems to illustrate all the different languages and components learnt as part of the course, breaking them down into three different 'Streams'.
    I am close to completed my first stream as an almost complete newbie to web development having only tinkered a little with dreamweaver, Mambo, and Joomla previously (and over a decade ago).
    
    ## A little breakdown of the various sections.
    
    ### Stream One
    #### HTML5
    The backbone of the web, HTML is the principle language used to build websites and thus our starting point.
    
    #### CSS3
    To a little more glitz to vanilla HTML we have CSS which applies styling parameters to websites.
    
    #### JavaScript
    More functionality is added with JavaScript. Will update this line.
    
    #### Cloud 9
    ### Stream Two
    
    ### Stream Three
