## Purpose behind this site.
From what I gather thus far, this site is part of my course work within my full-stack developer course through The Learning People in collaboration with the code institute.
It seems to illustrate all the different languages and components learnt as part of the course, breaking them down into three different 'Streams'.
I am close to completed my first stream as an almost complete newbie to web development having only tinkered a little with dreamweaver, Mambo, and Joomla previously (and over a decade ago).
